I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect with a background in Development and Networking and work for [Marathon Consulting, LLC](https://www.marathonus.com), based out of Virginia Beach, VA; where I focus on SharePoint, Office 365 and Azure. I have over 18 years of IT and Development experience (over 22 year if you include internship and college experience). 

For over 14 years years now, I worked mostly with SharePoint as an Administrator, and Developer. I started with SharePoint back in 2006, just months before Microsoft released SharePoint 2007. I began working with SharePoint 2003 and have worked with every version of SharePoint since including Online and 2019.
