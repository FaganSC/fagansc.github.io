Back in 2016, Microsoft unveiled the next development model for SharePoint called the SharePoint Framework (SPFx). Over the years, SharePoint Framework has evolved from the ability to create just SharePoint Webpart into a sophisticated framework that includes Field Customizer, ListView Command Set, Microsoft Teams tab apps, and much more.

So, what is SharePoint Framework? Well, SharePoint Framework, better known as SPFx, is a client-side development framework that utilizes modern development toolchains to create web parts and solutions for SharePoint Online. Someone in the SharePoint community once called SPFx “a formal way of creating the JavaScript web parts without content editor web parts.”

Microsoft has even moved all their SharePoint development for SharePoint first-party web parts into SPFx. Unlike previous SharePoint development models, this one is here to stay!
